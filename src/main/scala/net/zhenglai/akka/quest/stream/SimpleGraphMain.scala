  // Graphs are built from simple Flows which serve as the linear connections within the graphs as well as junctions which serve as fan-in and fan-out points for Flows.

  // Akka Streams currently provide these junctions
  // Fan-out
  //  Broadcast[T] => 1 -> N
  //  Balance[T]   => 1 -> N
  //  UnzipWith[In, A, B, ...] => 1 -> N
  //  Unzip[A, B] => 1 -> 2, splits a stream of (A, B) tuples into 2 streams


  // Fan-in
  //  Merge[In] => N -> 1, randomly picked from inputs
  //  MergePreferred[In], => N -> 1
  //  ZipWith[A, B, ..., Out]  => N -> 1
  //  Zip[A, B] => 2 -> 1
  //  Concat[A] => 2 -> 1, concatenate 2 streams (first consume one, then the second one)


  // Such graph is simple to translate to the Graph DSL since each linear element corresponds to a Flow,
  // and each circle corresponds to either a Junction or a Source or Sink if it is beginning or ending a Flow.
  // Junction reference equality defines graph node equality (i.e. the same merge instance used in a GraphDSL refers to the same location in the resulting graph).

  // Once the GraphDSL has been constructed though, the GraphDSL instance is immutable, thread-safe, and freely shareable.
  // The same is true of all graph piecesâ€”sources, sinks, and flows
